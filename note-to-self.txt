# Create DB backup in the given location

# Do Backup of the WP files + logfiles + Db Backup files
    # Compression? zlib?
    # Pruning?
    # Max size?
    # Frequency?
    # What needs to be excluded?


# Sync the backup to remote using Rclone
    # How about backup filling up space?
    # What if the server gets hacked - can he delete everything from remote location as well?

# Features we want

## Accept the following
    ### backup_dir (MANDATORY)
    ### wordpress_location
    ### wordpress_log_location
    ### site_name 

## Assume the following
    ### backup_dir -> ~/backups/site_name
    ### wordpress_location -> find it from nginx config
        ### For more than 1 nginx sites -> prompt which one to use
        ### backup all???
    ### include nginx config logs?
    ### site_name -> find it from nginx config -> or from wordops?
        # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32400933/how-can-i-list-all-vhosts-in-nginx
        # sudo nginx -T | perl -ln0777e '$,=$\; s/^\s*#.*\n//mg; print grep !$u{$_}++ && !m/^_$/, map m/(\S+)/g, m/\bserver_name\s++(.*?)\s*;/sg'
        # sudo nginx -T | grep "server_name " | sed 's/.*server_name \(.*\);/\1/'
            # -> Check if it starts with # (i.e. - deactivated)
            # -> Check if it has a corresponding (uncommented out) "root" in the same {} or any of the included files in that {}

## Do a borg init - if it is not NOT done on the backup_dir
    ### On init - show the key file on screen at the END (NOT on log)

## Log all output to backup_dir/logs folder
    ### Log rotate and delete if required
    ### If log_off been mentioned - send logs to /dev/null

## On ERROR -> output to backup_dir/logs/error
    ### Add it to system log as well - even if log_off



# For the README.md
    ## Ensure you have sudo
    ## If you have nginx and not providing the wordpress_location, wp_db_name, wp_db_username, wp_db_userpwd details - $ sudo nginx -t gives all OK
    ## Ensure you have enough space at the backup location
    ## If choosen to switch off log - check system error messages for "wp_backup_script_errors"
    ## DB backup is created and stored in tmp/wp_backup_script/site_name/db_bkp 
        ### This is deleted after successful backup
    ## If you want to schedule it - put it in appropriate location
        ### Explain where - give links for more details
    ## Runs on low priority - so system resources are NOT overloaded
    ## Which compression we use
    ## Which directories are excluded
    ## What if you want to add some custom directories to this backups?
    ## How to restore - for a particular date?
    ## Point to rclone to sync these backups to remote locations
    ## Point to init linux hardening for hardening linux servers
    ## Point to WordOps for easier wordpress installations
    ## MUST have a passphrase for your existing backup
